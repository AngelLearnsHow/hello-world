# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the Github flow and a CIS129 grade.

Hello class and Mr. Brice my name is Angel and this is something about me. I have a computer skill level above average compared to my friends and family but I never fully committed to what makes computers operate and have found coding as an interesting skill set, so since I know the basics of working a computer I figured I should leap into the world of Computer Science. I believe the computer science field will interest me the most because I've always loved tech and enjoyed the designing aspects of video games, websites, and software. I desire to learn the skills to program and design software or interfaces using my creativity. Becoming a skilled programmer will allow me to create websites and applications that are unique/visually appealing. This being said, I confidently feel like I should go into a career that would secure me with purpose and finances to live comfortably. By pursuing a career in software development and UI/UX design, I can ensure a quality lifestyle pertaining to the work-life I want. Outside of technology I also enjoy fashion and although I don't dress like it, I love how creative or detailed clothing can be as a whole. My dream would be to design a collection of clothes and create a website that's interactive, aesthetically appealing, and different than what's out there. 

I want to become a UI/UX designer
